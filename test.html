<p style="text-align: justify;">People with pancreatic cancer may experience the following symptoms or signs.&nbsp;Sometimes people with pancreatic cancer do not have any of these changes.&nbsp;<span class="">Or the cause of these symptoms may be a different medical condition other than cancer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors often say that pancreatic cancer is a "silent disease" because it does not have many noticeable symptoms early on.&nbsp;Also, at present, there are no tests that can reliably detect cancer in people who do not have symptoms.&nbsp;When people have symptoms, they are similar to symptoms of other medical conditions, such as ulcers or pancreatitis (see the&nbsp;Risk Factors&nbsp;section&nbsp;&nbsp;).&nbsp;As the cancer grows, symptoms can include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p>Yellowing of the skin and eyes, darkening of the urine, itching, and clay-colored stools, which are signs of jaundice caused by blocked bile ducts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pain in the upper abdomen or back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Painful swelling of an arm or leg due to a blood clot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burning sensation in the stomach or other gastrointestinal discomfort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stomach bloating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Floating stools with a particularly foul odor and unusual color, due to the body not digesting fats well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft spot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of appetite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nausea and vomiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaking chills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight loss for no apparent reason</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are concerned about any changes you have experienced, speak with your doctor.&nbsp;Your doctor will ask you how long and how often you have experienced the symptom (s), among other questions.&nbsp;This is to help find the cause of the problem, called a&nbsp;diagnosis&nbsp;.<br /><br />If cancer is diagnosed, symptom relief remains an important aspect of cancer care and treatment.&nbsp;This may be called hospice or supportive care.&nbsp;Be sure to talk to your healthcare team about the symptoms you are experiencing, including any new symptoms or changes in symptoms.</p>
